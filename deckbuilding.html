		<h1> Decks</h1>
		<h2> What is a deck?</h2>
		<p>There a total of 5 decks you can build and save also with pre-existing decks built
		for beginners that donâ€™t know how to build decks&#46; A deck consists of affinities of which
		there are 5&#46; (Chaos&#44; Order&#44; Growth&#44; Death and Knowledge) You can pick 2 affinities which
		decide what type of cards you can place in that deck&#46; You must also select 6 gems&#46; 
		Gems are boosts when purchasing attribute points to get cards&#44; with one being possibilly placed every 6th attribute 
		points in one of the three categories (Agility&#44; Intellect or Vitality&#46;) An attribute point costs 100 coins&#46;
		Your deck shall consist of 12 cards maximum&#44; 3 minimum&#46; During the start of a game&#44; you select one of the decks you shall
		use to play this hero this game&#46; Each the cards in each affinity have a generalization of what they buff&#46;
		After selecting your deck&#44; you carry on to buy cards by either buying them using points 
		or through coins you earn through the fight&#46; That is a summary of what decks are&#46;
		</p>
		<h2>Gems</h2>
		<p>In Paragon your deck can consist of 6 gems&#44; in one of the three sections Agility&#44; Intellect or Stamina&#46;
		Here is what each section is responsible for improving&#46;
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h4>Agility</h4>
		<p>Attribute points and Gems purchased in the agility section focus on improving your basic attack
		and how fast you farm coins so you can build your deck faster&#46; Most carry decks will focus on agility
		</p>
		<h4>Intellect</h4>
		<p>Attribute points and Gems purchased in the Intellect section will focus on changing the way ability
		attack perform&#44; and increase the amount of mana and how much experience you earn&#46;
		</p>
		<h4>Vitality</h4>
		<p>Attribute point and Gems purchased in the Vitality section will focus on increasing your health 
		and armor&#44; fighting against debuffs&#44; and mitigating ability or basic damage&#46;

		<h3>There are three different types of gems also&#44; Offense&#44; Defense and Utility&#46;</h3>
		<p>Offensive gems focus on boosting attack speed and attack damage&#46;</p>
		<p>Defensive gems focus on adding health regen&#44; armor points and increasing life expectancy&#46;</p>
		<p>Utility gems are gems that have a specific purpose&#44; that only activates when some attack or ability has been used&#46;</p>

		<h2>Cards</h2>
		<h3>Affinities</h3>
		<p>There are 5 different affinities of which you can select 2&#46;
		<br>
		Chaos&#44; Order&#44; Growth&#44; Death and Knowledge&#46;
		</p>
		<h4>Here is how they are classified&colon;</h4>
		<hr>
		<h3> Chaos</h3>
		<p>The Chaos affinity is responsible for the group of cards that support an aggressive style with cards that deal
		damage and increase all attack traits&#46; Their special property that applies to some cards is that they are &ldquo;Combustible&rdquo;
		meaning that on death the card will be discarded&#46; This is to balance how powerful the attack based cards are&#46;
		</p>
		<h3> Growth</h3>
		<p> Growth is the card group that specializes in defensive strategies&#44; such as boosting your health&#44; armor&#44; slowing enemies
		increasing movement speed&#44; (etc&#46;) Some cards in this deck have the property of Cultivate which reduces the overall cost
		of the card for each attribute point you have
		</p>
		<h3> Knowledge</h3>
		<p> The Knowledge affinity is a card group that supports a tactical playstyle&#44; with cards that promote knowing where 
		everything is and cards that allow you to outplay an opponent&#46; The special property these cards have in this deck 
		is that they consumables where after one use they will expire and be removed&#44; though they can be rebought and used again&#46;
		</p>
		<h3> Order</h3>
		<p> Order cards are based on a supportive playstyle&#44; where you prioritize your allies over your own survivability&#46;
		The property some of the cards in this deck is that some cards have the stat Elevate&#44; which makes it so that
		as your level or amount of attribute points go up the cards ability increases&#46;
		</p>
		<h3> Death</h3>
		<p> Death is responsible for the group of cards that recommends what Paragon calls an &ldquo;Insidious Playstyle&#44; bend the rules to your favor&rdquo;
		but the cards in death are more based on changing how your attacks work and your attack capabilities when something is present&#46; Its odd
		quirk that some of the cards have is a &ldquo;Cursed&rdquo; where the card can&#8216;t be discarded after being bought meaning that you are permanently
		stuck with that card which can be taxing in late game when you attempt to discard cards to improve your overall capabilities&#46;
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p> The reason deckbuilding is not recomended for beginners is cause all of this is quite complex and they don&#8216;t have many cards&#44; 
		as they haven&#8216;t opened enough chests to earn the cards needed&#46;  However after some time close to level 20 beginners should attempt 
		to start building decks to test things out and see what works for them&#46; They should try them out in AI matches until they get a hang of it&#46;
		The faster you learn the better you can help your team out as the basic decks only use the minimal amount of cards you start with&#46;
