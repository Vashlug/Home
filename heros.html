		<h1>Heroes</h1>
		<h2>The different types of heroes</h2>
		<p>There are 4 main different hero roles&#46; These classes have specific and a balanced team should always have one of each&#46;</p>
		<h3> Carry </h3>
		<p> The carry is a character that is weak during the early game phase but typically becomes one of the main damage providers later on&#46;
		He gets &ldquo;carried&rdquo; until he can level up and build his deck(A deck is a set of attributes you can buy to boost your playstyle/performance)
		Most of the damage he does is based on his basic/main attack so they should build towards attack speed and other properties&#46;
		During the early game phase carries should focus on earning coins to build his deck&#44; and should stick together with another teammate usually the support
		as they can be picked off and killed very easily when on their own during this phase&#46; However later on a carry can hold their
		own&#44; fighting against enemies and quickly dispatching of them&#46;
		</p>
		<h3>Support</h3>
		<p>The support is a character responsible for supporting the team&#46; Their main work is to stay in the safe lane and support the carry during the early game
		until they can support themselves till they can become stronger during the late game&#46; A secondary objective of them is to bounce from lane to lane&#44; 
		to support heroes when they are losing ground on their lane&#46; This should only be done if your carry is not in any danger and can hold his own for the time&#46;
		Some abilities they posses that they can use to help out would be health regen&#44; slowing &amp; stunning enemies&#44; providing shield&#44; crowd control and other 
		debuffs to make the enemy an easier &amp; less formidable target&#46;
		</p>
		<h3>Jungler</h3>
		<p>Junglers are the Hero units that are responsible for farming exp and card xp from killing minions in the jungle&#44; and by periodically hopping into lanes
		(usually offlane) to help kill and cover teammates&#46; They spend their time farming so they can quickly build their damage and fighting capabilities&#46;
		They also Gank lanes to kill and eliminate over extenders and players that et too greedy&#46; To gank is to catch a player by surprise and push them back 
		and punish them for pushing or taking a heavy toll on structures&#46; Another usage is to hop into a lane that has been abandoned to prevent the enemy 
		from taking out towers while your teammate goes back to base to regen health and mana&#46;
		</p>
		<h3>Midlaner</h3>
		<p>The central/2nd lane consists of heroes that rely on abilities for damage&#46; Many heroes use all of their mana up really fast through using all their abilities
		in one large burst to do the most damage&#44; and as a result&#44; are left vulnerable due to cooldowns&#46; Unlike a carry or fighter&#44; their auto attacks are usually
		quite weak&#46; It was essential to use your abilities wisely or you can be caught off guard with your abilities on cooldown and get ganked by a jungler or 
		rotating Support&#46; The midlaner is responsible to hop from one lane to another after outplaying the enemy midlaner to prevent a push&#46; They should rotate 
		efficiently so they can do the most damage in other lanes&#46;
		</p>
		<h3>Offlane</h3>
		<p>This lane is always at the very left&#44; opposite to the safe lane&#46;  Heroes that are capable of playing extremely well by themselves in lanes make good offlaners&#44;
		when harassing the Carry &amp; Support by yourself&#46; It&#8217;s typical that their deck will focus on providing enough survivability or movement abilities to save their own skin
		if things go sideways&#46; They are a big threat to the carry's farm early game&#44; attempting to slow down the progress of the Carryâ€™s deck development&#46; It's ideal to let the Carry
		push your lane so you can farm more efficiently and set up the Carry to accidentally over extend for a gank from your jungler&#46;
