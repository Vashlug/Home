		<h2> What is a MOBA?</h2>
		<p>Multiplayer online battle arena or a (MOBA)&#44; less commonly referred to as ARTS (action real&#45;time strategy)&#44; 
		is a type of strategy game that is a subgroup of real&#45;time action games&#46; It consists of players controlling one character 
		out of a selection to play with in one of the 2 teams fighting&#46; The objective of the game is to destroy enemy towers&#44; and 
		progress forward in your lane by destroying these structures until they reach the enemy’s base to destroy the final piece 
		to winning the game&#46; These characters are helped by artificially spawned characters referred to as minions&#44; which only have 
		a basic attack and take the damage the towers provide&#46; Player characters typically have various abilities specific to each 
		character and advantages that they can purchase that improve over the course of game so that they can turn the tide of fights 
		and that contribute to a team&#8217;s overall attacking capability&#46; MOBA games are a fusion of action games&#44; role-playing games and 
		real-time strategy games&#44; in which singular players have massive effects on the game as a whole&#46;
